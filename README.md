# Building an E-Commerce Clothing Classifier Model

This project demonstrates the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to automatically classify images of clothing items into distinct categories (e.g., T-shirts, trousers, shoes). The model helps automate product tagging for an e-commerce platform, improving inventory management and enabling customers to easily find specific products. The project uses PyTorch and FashionMNIST as the dataset for training and evaluation.
